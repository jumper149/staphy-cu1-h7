# Thermodynamics of a chain
This is my solution to a computer excercise from my course on Statistical Physics.

## Excercise
Imagine a chain built from *N* absolutely rigid rods of equal length *l = 1* which connect at freely moving joints.
The endpoints of the chain are held in place, separated by distance *L*.
Suppose that the chain is confined to a plane, and is in thermal equilibrium with temperature *τ*.
Compute the force that the chain exerts at the endpoints.
Plot this force as a function of length *L* in the cases when *N = 3, 5, 8*.
